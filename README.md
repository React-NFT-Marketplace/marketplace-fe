## Marketplace of the Multiverse v2's React Frontend

Mint, list, delist, and buy NFTs seamlessly using any supported chain.
Eg. You can mint Avax NFTs using your Moonbeam address, you can also buy Fantom NFTs using Moonbeam too.

Our all in one NFT marketplace works on all the chains too, while our NFT contract approvals are gasless.

In the demo, our Marketplace contract and our NFT (ERC721) contract are different to show that the Marketplace, in theory, is able to support all NFT contracts.
